  A ValueSetDefinition describes the rules that determine which entity references (value meanings) belong to a value
  set at a given point in time. The definition of what belongs in a value set can evolve over time, and it is possible
  for there to be multiple definitions active at any given point in time - perhaps one for a system in general use, a
  second for a newer system, and a third for testing. A ValueSetDefinition may or may not identify a specific version
  of a code system. The decision of which version is to be used depends on the context and needs of the community.
  ValueSetDefinition and the supporting model has been designed to allow multiple variations on the “binding” of
  definitions to value sets, code system versions to definitions, and the combination to concept domains.

  AssociatedEntitiesReference:
    description: |-
      The description of a set of entities that are associated with a referenced entity. This description names a
      reference entity and an association predicate, which identifies a set of entities that are related to the
      reference entity according to a given code system. The description can reference the direct targets of the
      association (children), the direct sources of the association (parents), the transitive closure of the
      association targets (descendants), the transitive closure of the association sources (ancestors) and can state
      whether all intermediate nodes are included in the closure or just the leaf nodes.

      Note that the terms “parent” and “children” are asserted in reference to the predicate itself. As an example, in
      the association “arm subClassOf bodyPart,” the “parent” is arm and the “child” is bodyPart.
    attributes:
      referencedEntity:
        description: |-
          The entity reference that is the root of the association description. referencedEntity is not considered to
          be part of the resolution of AssociatedEntitiesReference. If it is to be included in the final set, it must
          be explicitly named in a second SpecificEntityList construct.

          The code system that makes the association assertions.
        range: CodeSystemReference
        required: true
        inlined: true
      codeSystemVersion:
        description: |-
           The version of the code system that makes the association assertions. If present, codeSystemVersion must be
           a version of codeSystem. If this attribute is present, the referenced version of the code system will always
           be used to resolve the associations. If absent, the specific version of the code system to be used in
           resolution is determined in the resolve value set definition call itself.
        range: CodeSystemVersionReference
        inlined: true
      predicate:
        description: |-
          The association predicate to be used in resolving the definition entry. Depending on the setting of `reverse`,
          entity references that are the `object` or `predicate` (False) or `subject` of `predicate`
          (True) qualify.
        range: PredicateReference
        required: true
        inlined: true
      objectToSubject:
        description: |-
          False means that `rererencedEntity` serves in the subject role.  True means object.
        range: boolean
      transitiveClosure:
        description: |-
          If true and `predicate` is defined as being transitive, the transitive closure of `predicate` selects the
          candidates
        range: boolean
      leafOnly:
        description: |-
          False means that all entities in a transitive closure are included.  True means only entities that are not
          the subject (or object of objectToSubject is True) of a triple with `predicate` qualify.
        notes:
          - Question: do subjects of BNodes qualify?
        range: boolean

  SpecificEntityList:
    is_a: EntityReferenceList
    description: |-
      A list of specific entity references that are to be included in the definition. When specified in this form,
      the service must include all entities in this list whether they are known to the service or not, and whether
      they are currently ACTIVE or not.

  PropertyQueryReference:
    description: |-
      A description of a set of entity references that are determined by applying a filter to the attribute(s) or
      property(s) that appear in an EntityDescription in a specified code system.
    attributes:
      codeSystem:

        required: true
      codeSystemVersion:
        description: |-
          The version of the code system that makes the assertions. If present, codeSystemVersion must be a version of
          codeSystem. If this attribute is present, the referenced version of the code system will always be used to
          resolve the attributes or properties. If absent, the specific version of the code system to be used in
          resolution is determined in the resolve value set definition call itself.
        range: CodeSystemVersionReference

      filter:
        description: The filter to be applied to entities in the referenced code system.
        range: FilterComponent
        required: true

  CompleteCodeSystemReference:
    description: |-
      An entry that, when resolved, returns all of the active entity references in a given code system. This includes
      all entity references that appear as the source of one or more statements in the code system, whether the
      assertions are made directly by a version of the code system or indirectly by a version of a different code
      system that is imported. Note that targets are not included to prevent codes from rdf, rdfs, owl, etc. being
      included in this resolution set.
    attributes:
      codeSystem:
        description: A reference to the code system whose codes are to be included.
        range: CodeSystemReference
        required: true
        inlined: true
      codeSystemVersion:
        description: |-
          A reference to the specific version of the code system to include. If not supplied, the specific
          version of the code system is determined in the resolution call itself.
        range: CodeSystemVersionReference
        inlined: true

  CompleteValueSetReference:
    description: |-
      A reference to a value set that, when resolved, results in a set of entity references that are included in this
      entry. An entry of this type can just name a value set, meaning that the specific definition is determined in the
      resolve value set call, can name both a value set and value set definition, meaning that the specific definition
      is always used in the resolution. It can also specify one or more code system versions to be used in the
      resolution of the named value set.
    attributes:
      valueSet:
        description: A reference to the value set whose definition supplies a set of entity references.
        range: ValueSetReference
        inlined: true
        required: true
      valueSetDefinition:
        description: |-
          A reference to a particular definition of valueSet that is to be used in resolving this reference. If absent,
          the specific definition is determined by the resolve value set call. If present, valueSetDefinition must be
          a definition of valueSet and will always be used to resolve this entity set.
        range: ValueSetDefinitionReference
        inlined: true
      referenceCodeSystemVersion:
        description: |-
          A reference to a CodeSystemVersion that will be used to resolve this call. referenceCodeSy will only be used
          if one or more components of the resolution of value Set identify a code system without specifying a specific
          version. At most, only one version of a given code system may appear in the referenceCodeSystemVersion list.
          While CTS2 service implementations must resolve resolution calls for definitions that carry unused reference
          Code SystemV entries, they may choose to issue a warning at the time the definition is created or loaded.
        range: CodeSystemVersionReference
        inlined: true

  ExternalValueSetDefinition:
    is_a: OpaqueData
    description: |-
      A definition of a value set whose format and semantics is specified outside of the core
      TCCM specification. If a given CTTCCMS2 service recognizes the syntax and semantics of this definition, it may
      call the appropriate process to resolve it. If the definition is not recognized, a TCCM service implementation
      must not process the containing value set definition and, instead, return an error.
