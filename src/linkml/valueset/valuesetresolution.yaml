  ValueSet definitions can be resolved dynamically on an as needed basis, but they also can be transferred between
  systems without the necessity of maintaining complete copies of the code system versions that are used to resolve
  them. This model defines the output of a value set resolution request. It contains sufficient information that the
  request can be completely reproduced against a service instance the mirrors the state of the system doing the
  resolution. It also carries the result of the resolution that can be transferred and loaded into a system that
  does not mirror the source system state.
