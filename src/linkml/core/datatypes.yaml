  Ths module identifies the core data types that are used in the TCCM. The term “data type” refers to
  “a type whose instances are identified only by their value".

types:

  DateAndTime:
    uri: xsd:dateTime
    repr: str
    base: XSDDateTime
    description: |-
      Represents an “Instant” as defined in the OWL Time Specification . Implementations must be able to support
      temporal units of second, minute, hour, day, month, and year, and be able to represent and compare instances
      represented in any of these units. DateAndTime can only provide a partial ordering and, as a consequence, i
      s never used as an index, unique identifier, or to sequence data or events.

  NaturalNumber:
    uri: xsd:nonNegativeInteger
    base: int
    description: A non-negative integer (N). NatrualNumber is used exclusively for representing quantities.

  LocalIdentifier:
    typeof: string
    description: |-
      An identifier that uniquely references a class, individual, property, or other resource within the context of a
      specific TCCM service implementation. LocalIdentifier syntax must match the PNAME
      production as defined in the SPARQL Query Specification . LocalIdentifiers may begin with leading digits,
      where XML Local Identifiers and NameSpaceIdentifiers may not.
    notes:
      - |-
        We may want to tighten this definition up to meet the `irelative-ref` pattern --
        see: https://www.w3.org/TR/curie/#s_syntax and https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt

  NamespaceIdentifier:
    uri: xsd:NMTOKEN
    base: NCName
    description: |-
      An identifier that uniquely references the scoping namespace of an Entity (class, role, or individual)
      within the context of a TCCM service. NameSpaceIdentifier syntax must match the PNAME NS production as defined
      in the SPARQL Query Specification - meaning that it must begin with an alphabetic character
