  MapCatalogEntry is an entry in a catalog of maps that are known to a service implementation. They contain basic
  information about the resource including who created it, what it is for, etc. We anticipate that this particular
  model will be extended in subsequent versions to include information about the rule languages and interface
  requirements of the various maps but, at the moment this represents a core set of properties.

      An entry in a catalog of maps - organized collections of rules that describe how information encoded using one
      set of value meanings can be transformed into a second, related set of meanings. A map catalog contains
      information about who is responsible for creating and distributing the rules, the source code system or value set,
      the target code system or value set, how often the rules are updated, how they are distributed, etc.

      - CTS2 includes "`fromCodeSystem`" an x60toCodeSystemx60 TCCM accepts only value sets, one form of which is x60CodeSystemReferencex60

          Note that mapName is not necessarily globally unique and the about URI should be used whenever communication
