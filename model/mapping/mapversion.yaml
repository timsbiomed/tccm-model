  SimpleMapEntry:
    description: |-
      A map entry represents the set of mappings that share the same mapFrom entity identifier. There may be at most
      one MapEntry for any unique EntityDescription within the context of a given MapVersion. Note also that is
      considered unidirectional from the perspective of the TCCM model. If one wishes that, class A in code system C1
      maps to class T in code system C2, and visa versa, one needs to create two map versions - the first from a
      version of C1 to a version of C2 and the second from a version of C2 to a version of C1.

      "`SimpleMapEntry`" is used to represent simple maps that don't involve cascading rules, target expressions, etc.

    description: |-
      A set of instructions that, when interpreted in the proper context, returns a true/false value, where true means
      that the context meets the requirements set forth by the rule and false means that it doesn’t. Neither the syntax
      nor the semantics of map rules are included as part of the TCCM specification.
