classes:
  Filter:
    description: |-
      A collection of one or more filters. The result of applying a Filter component is the intersection of the sets of
      qualifying elements. As an example, a filter having two components - one which says that the rights attribute must
      exist and a second that says that the text “SNOMED” must appear in the synopsis would return all resources having
      BOTH a rights attribute and “SNOMED” in the description.

  FilterComponent:
    description: A restriction on an attribute, property, or special field.
    attributes:
      filterComponent:
        description: |-
          The name or URI of the property or model element to be filtered. Properties are referenced by
          their predicate and model elements all have URIs that are established by this specification.
        range: PredicateReference
        inlined: true
        multivalued: true
      matchAlgorithm:
        description: |-
          The algorithm to be used for testing the referenced component. Examples might include “starts with,”
          “regular expression match,” “exists,” “inRange,” etc.
        range: NameAndMeaningReference
        required: true
      matchValue:
        description: |-
          The value to be used in comparison. The structure and format of matchValue depends on the specific
          matchAlgorithm. As an example, a “startsWith” algorithm would be plain text, a “regularExpression” algorithm
          would have a regular expression while an “exists” algorithm would have nothing in the matchValue attribute.
        range: string
