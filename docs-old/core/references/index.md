# References schema


his diagram identifies all of the value domains that are used within the TCCM service itself. Each reference has a
domain, which frequently isn’t necessary to carry through to PSMs with strong type systems, a name that serves as a
unique permissible value within the context of the domain, a uri that references the intended meaning of name, and an
optional href that, if present, provides a link to a TCCM EntityDescription that provides definitions, descriptions,
etc. of the meaning.

The NameAndMeaningReference pattern represents, at the meta-level, one of the key purposes for a TCCM based service
to establish lists of value domains (identified here by ReferenceType) from which sets of permissible values and
meanings can be drawn.

For each specific reference below we attempt to identify an ontology or value set from which the set of possible
values could be drawn. We then state whether this set is mandatory, meaning that it must be used in a compliant
TCCM implementation, recommended, meaning that, while not required, we anticipate that significant gains in
interoperability would result were it used, or simply exemplar, meaning that the set carries examples of what
might be used.
