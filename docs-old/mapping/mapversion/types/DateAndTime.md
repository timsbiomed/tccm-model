# Type: DateAndTime


Represents an “Instant” as defined in the OWL Time Specification . Implementations must be able to support
temporal units of second, minute, hour, day, month, and year, and be able to represent and compare instances
represented in any of these units. DateAndTime can only provide a partial ordering and, as a consequence, i
s never used as an index, unique identifier, or to sequence data or events.
