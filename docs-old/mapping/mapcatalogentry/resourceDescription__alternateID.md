# Type: resourceDescription__alternateID


An alternative identifier that uniquely names this resource in other environments as contexts.
As an example, if a resource had both an ISO Object Identifier and a DNS name, the DNS name might be assigned
as the entryID of the resource by one service while the ISO OID would be recorded as an alternateURI using
the “urn:oid” prefix. Note that alternateIds can be added or removed during resource updates.
