## TCCM Model
The goal of the Terminology Core Common Model (TCCM) is to accomodate terminology
resources from disparate data models. It will, by necessity, assemble its data 
from ouside (ideally definitive) sources.

The TCCM model is the set of [LinkML](https://github.com/linkml/linkml)-based 
definitions of the data models core to TCCM.

## Disambiguation
Not to be confused with [TCCM Model (lite)](https://github.com/HOT-Ecosystem/tccm-model).

[TCCM Model (lite)](https://github.com/HOT-Ecosystem/tccm-model) is a much 
simpler version of the model, used by the current [TCCM API](
https://github.com/HOT-Ecosystem/tccm-api).

[TCCM Model (full spec)](https://github.com/HOT-Ecosystem/tccm) is in development, 
but is ultimately intended to supplant the existing, 'lite' version of the model.
