# Valuesetdefinition schema


A ValueSetDefinition describes the rules that determine which entity references (value meanings) belong to a value
set at a given point in time. The definition of what belongs in a value set can evolve over time, and it is possible
for there to be multiple definitions active at any given point in time - perhaps one for a system in general use, a
second for a newer system, and a third for testing. A ValueSetDefinition may or may not identify a specific version
of a code system. The decision of which version is to be used depends on the context and needs of the community.
ValueSetDefinition and the supporting model has been designed to allow multiple variations on the “binding” of
definitions to value sets, code system versions to definitions, and the combination to concept domains.
