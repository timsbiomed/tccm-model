# Type: resourceDescription__about


The (or a) definitive URI that represents the resource being described. Note that this is NOT the URI of the
resource description in the TCCM or other format, but of the resource itself. As an example, the about URI
for the Wine ontology would be “http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-owl-guide-2003 1209/wine#.” The NCI Thesaurus
has, among others, the about URI of http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/xml/owl/EVS/Thesaurus.owl#. HL7 uses ISO Object
Identifiers (OIDs) to label resources so, from the HL7 perspective, the about URI of the NCI Thesaurus would
be “urn:oid:2.16.840. 1.113883.3.26.1.1”
