# Type: resourceVersionDescription__documentURI


A URI that identifies the specific version, language, and notation of the about resource. This URI needs to be constructed in such a way that, if necessary, it will be possible to differentiate resource versions that were loaded from different document syntaxes. As an example, if an image of a wine ontology was loaded from a resource that was in Manchester Syntax, it should be given a different URI than the image loaded from the RDF/XML syntax. The reasoning behind this is, even in cases where different syntaxes are 100% compatible the transformation into the TCCM model may not be identical.
