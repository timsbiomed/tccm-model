# Type: Filter


A collection of one or more filters. The result of applying a Filter component is the intersection of the sets of
qualifying elements. As an example, a filter having two components - one which says that the rights attribute must
exist and a second that says that the text “SNOMED” must appear in the synopsis would return all resources having
BOTH a rights attribute and “SNOMED” in the description.
