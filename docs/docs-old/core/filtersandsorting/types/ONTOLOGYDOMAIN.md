# Type: ONTOLOGY_DOMAIN


While the domain can refer to any topic ontology it is advised to use one of the established general purpose
topic hierarchy like DMOZ or domain specific topic like ACM for the computer science domain. Only this way it can
be ensured that meaningful information about the relation of the domains of two separate ontologies can be
deduced (OMV 5.1 1)(sic).
