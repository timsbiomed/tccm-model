# Type: CONTEXT


External and environmental factors that serve to discriminate among multiple possible selections. While it is
assumed that the specific contexts referenced by CONTEXT are represented by entity descriptions contained in
some ontology or coding scheme, the CTS2 specification does not recommend any targets. Note, however, the TCCM
context is intended to represent the notion of “jurisdictional domain” or “realm” as described in the HL7 CTS2 SFM .
